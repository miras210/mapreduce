Sitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated

Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes

So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes

I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing

Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too

And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn

But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes

Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes

'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug

Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

So I have so many wishes
I don't wanna fuck these bithes
Programming make me feel better
Overriding getter, setter
I'm not sure if I am lazy
Or I'm scared of new letters
From hr and LinkedIn
Yes I have all of these wishes
And not going just to save them
They are not giving me a pleasure
Achieving them will be a treasure
Don't afraid to just get failed
Be afraid to not to try
Now we are talking normal shit, damn

Why am I
Tired of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
But I'm feeling jealous too
And as hell it's complicated
So it makes me motivated
Want it all not for opinion
Not for money nor for image
Living life with no regrets
Man, I'm trembling, but I did that

But no one said it will be easy
Cost of life with no regrets
Will make you mind - feel little dizzy
Never think that there is justice
You will face a lot occasions
That will make you feel the hatred
But don't lose the hope unbattled
If your parents and relatives
Always say you to give up
Man, just never make these changes
'Cuz you'll end up like a slug
What's the point of life you mentioned
Hey, the fuck I know about it
Damn, there is your head, isn't it?
Find the answer for yourself, shit

You know what
I made this shit
Just because I really want it
Don't forget the things you wantedSitting, talking to the cat
Asking 'bout the life so bad
Why am I feeling so mad
He just meowes that my "Life is sad"
I just wanna sleep in my crib
Without seeing all of this shit
I just wanna do nothing
But at same time everything

Why am I
Scared of this
I just wanna be big man
Doing creative shit damn
They say
Just get it done
Do whatever it takes
You can deal with your mistakes
I do make people jealous
